##How to run

In the project directory run ``npm install`` and after that run `npm start` command, which will start development
server and open a tab with a running app in the browser.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app locally in the development mode using webpack dev server.<br />
Open [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder using webpack bundle.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and uglified and the filenames include the hashes. <br />

### `npm run dev`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder using webpack bundle.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The files are not minified nor uglified in order to make debugging possible on dev server. <br />
